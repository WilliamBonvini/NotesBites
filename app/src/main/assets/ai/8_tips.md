# Tips

- Is [a] logically entailed by the KB? Explain why. 
  Formula [a] is logically entailed by the KB because resolution is a sound inference procedure

  

- tree policy: method used to choose the most urgent node to visit
  default policy: policy of choosing the nodes inside a simulation

  

- The Arc Consistency algorithm cannot be applied to the problem formulated in (1) because the constraints are not binary, and thus a constraint graph cannot be defined.

- Factoring:
  $A \or A = A$ 

- Explain why depth-first search strategy is preferred over breadth-first search strategy in solving CSPs:
  Because all solutions are at depth n (= number of variables) and no cost is associated to solutions (path is irrelevant).
