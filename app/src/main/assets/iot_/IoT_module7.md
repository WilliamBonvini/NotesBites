# IoT Platforms

IIoT is about data sensed and transmitted from objects. The “real” goal is to develop services/applications to gather, manage and use such data. You need “tools” to ease up your life along the way. These tools are called “platforms”: piece of software that controls IoT systems (communication, configuration), abstract the complexity.

IoT platforms ease up life for implementation.
