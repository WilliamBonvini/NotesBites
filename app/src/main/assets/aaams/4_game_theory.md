# Game Theory

We start from an assumption: agents/players are rational $\to $ every player has a utility function/objective function and will correctly maximize it. 

***Types of Games***

- <u>Non cooperative game theory</u>       
  every player has a utility and maximizes the utility with a mechanism(rules)
- <u>Cooperative game theory</u>  
  I give you the rules and the players;   
  I ask you which are the best strategies the players can have;   
  Players try to find an agreement based on some axiomatic approach; 
- <u>Mechanism design</u>  
  You are required to design the rules of the game; auction. 
- <u>Social choice theory</u>  
  Voting.

 ***Non Cooperative Games***

They can be represented with:

-  a sequential structure (game tree)   

or 

- a normal form: the game tree structure is discarded

***Normal form games***

$(N, A, U)$

- $N$  
  set of players. for example $N=\{1,2,3,…,n\}$
- $A$   
  set of actions of players. for example $A=\{A_1, A_2, A_3,…,A_n\}$ ==where $A_1= \text{set of actions of player } 1$==.
- $U$   
  collection $U=\{U_1, U_2, …, U_n\}$ where $U_1= \text{utility function of player $1$}$.  
  A Utility Function is a function defined as  $U1: A_1\times A_2\times \dots \times A_n \to \R$

 ***Action Profile***

$a=(a_1, a_2,…,a_m)$ denotes the set of  actions for a particular player (I suppose!).

The maximization of its utility is the goal of the player.
