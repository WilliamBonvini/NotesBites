# Nash Equilibrium 

***Subgame***

A **subgame** is any part (a subset) of a game that meets the following criteria:

1. It has a single initial node that is the only member of that node's information set.
2. If a node is contained in the subgame then so are all of its successors.
3. If a node in a particular information set is in the subgame then all members of that information set belong to the subgame.

Think of them as subtrees.  
Each subtree can be seen as a smaller game self contained.

Something useful we can do with subgames:

***Sub Perfect Equilibrium***

It's a strategy profile that is in equilibrium in any subgame.
